# Text-Summariser
Text Summariser based on RNN-LSTM and Tensorflow

I implemented 2 models : - 

1.) RNN-LSTM

2.)Tensorflow MLP

# Requirements

1.) Tensorflow (Latest Version 1.8.0 or above)

2.) Keras using Tensorflow as backend

3.) NLTK

4.) Numpy

5.) Pandas

6.) Tensorflow_hub

7.) Langdetect

# Datasets

1.) Dataset for RNN is in the folder.

2.) Dataset for Tensorflow MLP can be found here - https://www.kaggle.com/snapcrack/all-the-news

# Algorithms Used

1.) Encoder-Decoder Model

2.) Bidirectional RNN

3.) Beam Search and Greedy Decoding

# Observations

1.) The RNN-LSTM Model gave an accuracy of 64.62% with an average loss of 2.12761.

2.) The Tensorflow Model gave an accuracy of 61.37% with an average loss of 4.60239
